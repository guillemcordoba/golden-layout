 *
 * This means that we deal with a tree of windows. Therefore, we do the event propagation in two phases:
 *
 * - Propagate events from this layout to the parent layout
 *   - Repeat until the event arrived at the root layout
 * - Propagate events to this layout and to all children
 *   - Repeat until all layouts got the event
 *
 * **WARNING**: Only userBroadcast events are propagated between windows.
 * This means the you have to take care of propagating state changes between windows yourself.
